## 🔑 About Caesar Cipher  
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.  
It was used by Julius Caesar to send secret military messages.  
The idea is simple: shift each letter of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.  

For example, with a shift of `3`:  

A → D  
B → E  
C → F  
...  
X → A  
Y → B  
Z → C

## ⚡ Features  
- Encrypts plain text messages.  
- Decrypts encoded text when you provide the shift key.  
- Works with any shift value between 1–25.  
- Simple, beginner-friendly Java implementation.
